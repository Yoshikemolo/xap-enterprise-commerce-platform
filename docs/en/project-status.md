## 🛠️ Technology Implementation Guide

### Products Service Architecture Example
```typescript
// Domain Entity with Batch Management
export class Stock extends AggregateRoot {
  // FIFO/FEFO Logic Implementation
  reserveStock(quantity: number, orderId: string, preferFEFO: boolean = true): { batchNumber: string; quantity: number }[] {
    const availableBatches = this._batches
      .filter(batch => batch.status === BatchStatus.AVAILABLE && batch.availableQuantity > 0)
      .sort((a, b) => {
        if (preferFEFO && a.expirationDate && b.expirationDate) {
          return a.expirationDate.getTime() - b.expirationDate.getTime();
        }
        return a.createdAt.getTime() - b.createdAt.getTime(); // FIFO fallback
      });
    // ... reservation logic
  }
}

// Command Handler Example
@CommandHandler(ReserveStockCommand)
export class ReserveStockCommandHandler implements ICommandHandler<ReserveStockCommand> {
  async execute(command: ReserveStockCommand): Promise<{ batchNumber: string; quantity: number }[]> {
    const stock = await this.stockRepository.findById(command.stockId);
    const reservations = stock.reserveStock(command.quantity, command.orderId, command.preferFEFO);
    await this.stockRepository.save(stock);
    return reservations;
  }
}
```

### Batch Traceability System
```typescript
// Value Object for Batch Numbers
export class BatchNumber {
  constructor(value: string) {
    this.validate(value);
    this._value = value.toUpperCase().trim();
  }
  
  static generateBatch(prefix?: string): BatchNumber {
    const timestamp = Date.now().toString(36);
    const random = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 5);
    const batchValue = prefix ? `${prefix}-${timestamp}-${random}` : `${timestamp}-${random}`;
    return new BatchNumber(batchValue);
  }
}

// Stock Batch Interface
export interface StockBatch {
  batchNumber: string; // Unique batch identifier
  quantity: number;
  availableQuantity: number;
  reservedQuantity: number;
  productionDate?: Date;
  expirationDate?: Date;
  supplier?: string;
  cost?: number;
  location?: string; // Specific warehouse location
  status: BatchStatus;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```
